                    A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains
                    flour,
                    sugar
                    and some type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate
                    chips,
                    nuts,
                    etc.

                        Bar cookies consist of batter or other ingredients that are poured or pressed into a pan
                        (sometimes
                        in multiple layers) and cut into cookie-sized pieces after baking. In British English, bar
                        cookies
                        are known as "tray bakes".[2] Examples include brownies, fruit squares, and bars such as date
                        squares.

                        Drop cookies are made from a relatively soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking
                        sheet. During baking, the mounds of dough spread and flatten. Chocolate chip cookies (Toll House
                        cookies), oatmeal raisin (or other oatmeal-based) cookies, and rock cakes are popular examples
                        of
                        drop cookies. This may also include thumbprint cookies, for which a small central depression is
                        created with a thumb or small spoon before baking to contain a filling, such as jam or a
                        chocolate
                        chip.[12] In the UK, the term "cookie" often refers only to this particular type of product.

                        Filled cookies are made from a rolled cookie dough filled with a fruit, jam or confectionery
                        filling
                        before baking. Hamantashen are a filled cookie.

                        Molded cookies are also made from a stiffer dough that is molded into balls or cookie shapes by
                        hand
                        before baking. Snickerdoodles and peanut butter cookies are examples of molded cookies. Some
                        cookies, such as hermits or biscotti, are molded into large flattened loaves that are later cut
                        into
                        smaller cookies.

                        No-bake cookies are made by mixing a filler, such as cereal or nuts, into a melted confectionery
                        binder, shaping into cookies or bars, and allowing to cool or harden. Oatmeal clusters and rum
                        balls
                        are no-bake cookies.

                        Pressed cookies are made from a soft dough that is extruded from a cookie press into various
                        decorative shapes before baking. Spritzgeb√§ck is an example of a pressed cookie.

                        Refrigerator cookies (also known as icebox cookies) are made from a stiff dough that is
                        refrigerated
                        to make the raw dough even stiffer before cutting and baking. The dough is typically shaped into
                        cylinders which are sliced into round cookies before baking. Pinwheel cookies and those made by
                        Pillsbury are representative.

                        Rolled cookies are made from a stiffer dough that is rolled out and cut into shapes with a
                        cookie
                        cutter. Gingerbread men are an example
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sandwich cookies are rolled or pressed cookies that are assembled as a sandwich with a sweet
                        filling. Fillings include marshmallow, jam, and icing. The Oreo cookie, made of two chocolate
                        cookies with a vanilla icing filling, is an example.
